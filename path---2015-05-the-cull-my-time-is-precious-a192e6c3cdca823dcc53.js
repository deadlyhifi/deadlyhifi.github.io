I’ve not had time to keep up with my constant stream of information. Then I listened to <a href="http://www.merlinmann.com/roderick/ep-122-parliament-of-the-moment.html">Roderick on the Line #122 – Parliament of the Moment</a> (I’m a little behind on Roderick, they’re on 155 now. If only I had more time).</p>\n<p>Basically, John and Merlin discuss phone distraction. The constant stream of information coming at you and the vying of your attention.</p>\n<p>I have a 4 year old son, he demands attention, lots and lots of it. Sometimes I give that attention to my phone. I feel bad about that. “Am I missing something?”; gnaws away at me. Any opportunity to whip the phone out and check, I take it. I’m an addicted slave.</p>\n<p>Who I follow started around 7 years ago. Twitter was fairly new and I worked at Singletrack. I followed people and they followed me because of my connection to bikes. People I don’t know. They’re interesting and nice people. But they’re not friends, they’re not even acquaintances. Most I’ve never even met. I haven’t unfollowed because of my desire to not offend anyone. I wouldn’t unfollow if they followed me. That’s when I started my list system.</p>\n<p>At time of writing I follow 224 people on Twitter. I manage this into lists.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The people I work with</li>\n<li>A list of “devs” – to get information about what’s going on in the developer community</li>\n<li>Apps – information about apps that I use</li>\n<li>✩ – the fun list. People I know. Things that make me laugh.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This totals about 100 that I actively follow.</p>\n<p>I can’t be bothered anymore. I love you all but I don’t love you so much that you can take my precious time. That 100 “active follow” list will be dwindling too.</p>\n<p>This is free reign to unfollow me. I won’t be offended.</p>\n<p>If you need me, you can find me.</p>',frontmatter:{title:"The Cull (my time is precious)",date:"May 25, 2015"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2015/05/the-cull-my-time-is-precious/",previous:{fields:{slug:"/2015/04/squarethreat/"},frontmatter:{title:"Squarethreat"}},next:{fields:{slug:"/2015/08/laracon-eu-2015-day-1/"},frontmatter:{title:"Laracon EU 2015 – Day 1"}}}}}});
