I’ve spent the entire bank holiday weekend decorating. I’ve not had time to keep up with my constant stream of information. Then I listened to [Roderick on the Line #122 – Parliament of the Moment](http://www.merlinmann.com/roderick/ep-122-parliament-of-the-moment.html) (I’m a little behind on Roderick, they’re on 155 now. If only I had more time).

Basically, John and Merlin discuss phone distraction. The constant stream of information coming at you and the vying of your attention.

I have a 4 year old son, he demands attention, lots and lots of it. Sometimes I give that attention to my phone. I feel bad about that. "Am I missing something?"; gnaws away at me. Any opportunity to whip the phone out and check, I take it. I’m an addicted slave.

Who I follow started around 7 years ago. Twitter was fairly new and I worked at Singletrack. I followed people and they followed me because of my connection to bikes. People I don’t know. They’re interesting and nice people. But they’re not friends, they’re not even acquaintances. Most I’ve never even met. I haven’t unfollowed because of my desire to not offend anyone. I wouldn’t unfollow if they followed me. That’s when I started my list system.

At time of writing I follow 224 people on Twitter. I manage this into lists.

* The people I work with
* A list of "devs" – to get information about what’s going on in the developer community
* Apps – information about apps that I use
* ✩ – the fun list. People I know. Things that make me laugh.

This totals about 100 that I actively follow.

I can’t be bothered anymore. I love you all but I don’t love you so much that you can take my precious time. That 100 "active follow" list will be dwindling too.

This is free reign to unfollow me. I won’t be offended.

If you need me, you can find me.
