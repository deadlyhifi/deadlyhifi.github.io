Then I keep forgetting and scratch my head for half an hour everytime, so I‚Äôm writing it down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here‚Äôs a simple class, &lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;MyStore&lt;/code&gt;, that needs to do stuff when the &lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;document.readyState&lt;/code&gt; is complete. The default export is wrapped in &lt;a href=&quot;http://alt.js.org/docs/createStore/&quot;&gt;AltJs createStore&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;export MyStore {
	construct() {
		if (this.getDocumentReadyState() !== &apos;complete&apos;) {
			return;
		}

		this.userAgent = this.getUserAgent();
		// do all the things ü¶ã
	}

	getDocumentReadyState() {
        	return document.readyState;
	}

    ...
}

export default alt.createStore(MyStore, &apos;MyStore&apos;);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Testing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first test here is to make sure nothing happens if the document isn‚Äôt ready, so we need to stub &lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;getDocumentReadyState()&lt;/code&gt;. But because the default export is wrapped in &lt;a href=&quot;http://alt.js.org&quot;&gt;AltJs&lt;/a&gt; we can‚Äôt get to the actual &lt;code&gt;MyStore&lt;/code&gt; to stub the method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure &lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;MyStore&lt;/code&gt; is exported as well as the default export, then in your test import &lt;code&gt;MyStore&lt;/code&gt; (this is the wrapped one), and also import the unwrapped class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;import MyStore, {MyStore as UnwrappedMyStore} from ‚Äô../../../src/stores/MyStore‚Äô;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can then stub &lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;getDocumentReadyState&lt;/code&gt; from the unwrapped class before firing the event that this store listens to; and make your assertion(s) as appropriate. I‚Äôm using &lt;a href=&quot;http://sinonjs.org/releases/v2.3.6/stubs/&quot;&gt;Sinon to stub the method&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don‚Äôt forget to use &lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;UnwrappedMyStore.prototype&lt;/code&gt; to reference the class. &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes&quot;&gt;JS classes are just syntactic sugar&lt;/a&gt; and add the methods to the prototype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;documentReadyState = sinon.stub(
	UnwrappedMyStore.prototype,
	&apos;getDocumentReadyState&apos;
).returns(&apos;interactive&apos;);

// dispatch action

chai.expect(MyStore.getState().userAgent).to.be.undefined;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

Do you take your rubbish out? Have a tidy up? When it‚Äôs aged do you redecorate? When you feel like a change, for your surroundings to work better, do you remodel?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why? Things get used, your needs change over time‚Ä¶ you need to keep a mental model of where things are so you can find them. When you stop using things you have a clear out; A spring clean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The same needs to happen with your code.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software Developers/Engineers understand this but often fail to get the message across to management, marketing, whoever is pulling the strings. They fail to understand the need to refactor and do some ‚Äúhousekeeping‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was recently told in a training session:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúFor every twenty lines of code there is 1 bug‚Äù, and ‚Äúevery four to six week refactor for 1 week‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That last one I could really get behind. The problem is your software is working. That one bug is probably obscure, an edge case that didn‚Äôt crop up in testing; or it was observed but was so hard to reproduce that it slipped through the gaps - and the clock is ticking, time is money. Release early, remember!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often we release early and everyone is happy - except the devs - they receive their praise ‚Äúhooray, you got it out, have a beer!‚Äù, but they‚Äôre not satisfied; it‚Äôs not quite right, it could be more efficient, that bit could really do with a refactor. They told the management too, ‚Äúonce we‚Äôve done this we need a bit of time to sort it out‚Äù. ‚ÄúOf course!‚Äù Said the management. But the management, even with their good intentions are already thinking about the next thing. New demands and deadlines start appearing, and that refactor‚Ä¶?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There‚Äôs a missing understanding. That absolute need to refactor, to rip out old code, all the maintenance tasks are required to stop the product from being painted into a corner. They‚Äôre required not just for the product itself to keep running, to be adaptable to future feature requests, but also for the wellbeing of the devs. That ever increasing load of ‚Äúwe must remember to do that‚Äù, ‚Äúhow did that feature work again?‚Äù, and most of all ‚Äúwhy is this here? I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs used anymore but I‚Äôm too afraid to remove it‚Äù takes its toll. It‚Äôs mentally tiring. Fitting in the secret refactors and fixes on other tasks - just to get them done. And worst of all it makes developers leave. They become tired and wary. Onto the next place that promises to &lt;em&gt;do things properly&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What‚Äôs the answer? Keep driving the message home? Metaphor after metaphor - like the openings of this post. But there are only so many ways to say the same thing. If the management isn‚Äôt on board with removing technical debt the management isn‚Äôt on board with having a quality product. Of course there‚Äôs going to be compromise, devs do have to be kept in line because nothing is ever finished, but take the time to listen. If you don‚Äôt your product will start to crack and before you know it you‚Äôll need a rebuild. A rebuild that could have been an evolution of your existing product because the core of it, the foundations, was stable.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[My 2016 Year in Review]]></title><description><![CDATA[2016 has been dire: Brexit, Snoopers charter, Donald Trump, I despair ‚Äì but personally it has been a triumph. At the beginning of this year‚Ä¶]]></description><link>https://gatsbyjs.github.io/gatsby-starter-blog//2016/12/my-2016-year-in-review/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://gatsbyjs.github.io/gatsby-starter-blog//2016/12/my-2016-year-in-review/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 24 Dec 2016 06:40:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;2016 has been dire: Brexit, Snoopers charter, Donald Trump, I despair ‚Äì but personally it has been a triumph. At the beginning of this year I set myself a challenge ‚Äì to move up. Well, actually the challenge started about 3 years ago. The challenge then was to catch up ten years of career development; the 10 years that I had dealt with cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2017 will mark 10 years since my stem cell transplant. And in preparation for that I wanted to be happy with my career development. I can now safely say I‚Äôve achieved my goal (I have new goals, but that‚Äôs another story).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the start of 2016 I was working in a web agency. A wonderful 2 year experience but I‚Äôd started to pick holes in it and I felt I had met a ceiling in terms of personal and professional development. To continue the journey I had to once again get out of my comfort zone and face the next challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sky Betting and Gaming was recruiting and I thought I‚Äôd give it a go. More than half expecting to fail (imposter syndrome is strong wit this one), I made it through and in May I started work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around the same time I also took over the running of &lt;a href=&quot;http://leedsphp.org&quot;&gt;LeedsPHP&lt;/a&gt; user group through which I‚Äôve met lots of people and faced many a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs been a very tough year. A year of facing my fears head on. A wake up call of how much I have to learn in terms of development practice, working in a large company, surrounded by incredibly talented individuals, constant learning‚Ä¶ the list goes on. There have been plenty of times when I‚Äôve felt it all too much, but I‚Äôve taken a step back and said to myself, sometimes out loud ‚Äî ‚Äúthis is exactly what you wanted, so deal with it!‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I did it. So I‚Äôm giving myself a big pat on the back. It‚Äôs quite amazing what a difference a year can make. In the words of George McFly, ‚ÄúIf you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On to the next part of the plan.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Super Duper Power Key (change capslock, you don't use it anyway)]]></title><description><![CDATA[Brett Terpstra (a power user hero)  wrote about this back in 2012 , and here I am documenting my version of it (and the apps have since been‚Ä¶]]></description><link>https://gatsbyjs.github.io/gatsby-starter-blog//2016/02/super-duper-power-key-change-capslock-you-don-t-use-it-anyway/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://gatsbyjs.github.io/gatsby-starter-blog//2016/02/super-duper-power-key-change-capslock-you-don-t-use-it-anyway/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 08 Feb 2016 21:29:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Brett Terpstra (a power user hero) &lt;a href=&quot;http://brettterpstra.com/2012/12/08/a-useful-caps-lock-key&quot;&gt;wrote about this back in 2012&lt;/a&gt;, and here I am documenting my version of it (and the apps have since been renamed).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The capslock key is somewhat useless yet it takes up so much space on the keyboard. Power users (like me, ha) also have a lot of keyboard shortcuts defined and you don‚Äôt want to accidentally overwrite existing shortcut keys, so, I‚Äôve remapped my caps lock key to be¬†‚åÉ‚å•‚áß‚åò (that‚Äôs control, alt, shift, command) all in one go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alfredapp.com&quot;&gt;Alfred App&lt;/a&gt; to create custom commands to launch apps and run scripts based on hotkeys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, un-map you caps-lock key from being a caps-lock key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;System Preferences &gt; Keyboard &gt; Modifier Keys‚Ä¶ and set Caps Lock to ‚ÄúNo Action‚Äù.

&lt;p&gt;That‚Äôs it, you‚Äôre now free to create a whole load of shortcuts without risk of overwriting anything. In the Brett Terpstra article he has the key be an escape key on short press and super duper key on long press. I took the escape bit out as I didn‚Äôt want that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like I said, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alfredapp.com&quot;&gt;Alfred App&lt;/a&gt; lets you create all sorts of commands, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/actions/launch-apps-files&quot;&gt;toggling apps through a hotkey&lt;/a&gt;.

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm on the train home from London after 2 of days of learning about the new WordPress REST API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day one was the conference itself, and the second a hack day. The whole event was organised by &lt;a href=&quot;https://hmn.md&quot;&gt;Human Made&lt;/a&gt;, who‚Äôs employees, among others, have been spearheading the project ‚Äî A project that is going to change people‚Äôs attitudes towards websites. It may sound a bit dramatic, but I firmly believe that it‚Äôs going to push developers to raise their game and increase experience expectations from web site user‚Äôs perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We‚Äôve started to see ‚Äúsingle page apps‚Äù and native app style web experiences from big players over the past few years, but now with WordPress offering the foundations to build these things right into the core product it opens new doors for everyone. The barrier to entry has been lowered and will continue to lower as it matures, examples and articles are written, and ideas permeate through the very large and active WordPress community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talks themselves were all excellent ‚Äì I‚Äôm hard pushed to choose a favourite as they flowed perfectly and progressively built on the ideas presented by the previous speakers. A perfect package of presentations. The day ended with me very excited as to the possibilities. It‚Äôs time to dive into JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great after party, too. Beer is expensive in London. That‚Äôs just the way it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day 2 brought the ‚Äúhack day‚Äù, luckily it didn‚Äôt start until 10:30, I was feeling a bit rough because I‚Äôd spent too much money the night before. Having never attended a hack day before I wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect. I was a bit apprehensive to be honest but I figured ‚Äúwhat the hell?‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was set at the Mozilla offices, which are far nicer than my office and probably nicer than your office too. Around 60 people attended. Starting with people suggesting ideas to ‚Äúhack on‚Äù it immediately felt very relaxed and &lt;em&gt;community&lt;/em&gt; like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got involved with the documentation, in a team of 7. Firstly we discussed how we‚Äôd like to see the documentation improved and then after lunch we got on with it. I got a commit accepted and merged to make it more clear that version 2 docs were available. Not the most exciting or taxing thing in the world, but still, it needed doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next time I‚Äôd probably tackle a coding issue now I‚Äôm more confident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a great time and I learnt an enormous amount. I‚Äôm so pleased to have gone.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Laracon EU 2015 ‚Äì Day 2]]></title><description><![CDATA[I was far more refreshed on day two after resisting the urge to go out with the people I‚Äôd met the night before.

I half regretted it as it turned out some prominent members of the community were out, but ne‚Äômind. I slept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After being somewhat shocked when my Airbnb host turned up unexpectedly as I sat eating my breakfast in my underpants, I headed to the conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were three standouts for me on this day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚òÖ Jessica Rose ‚Äì Impostor syndrome and individual competence &lt;small&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;http://joind.in/talk/view/15019&quot;&gt;joind.in&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôd be very surprised if not everyone in the room didn‚Äôt suffer from this to a certain extent. There was some good advice on dealing with it, how to behave when others are suffering from it, and an overall sense on ‚ÄúActually, I‚Äôm OK‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚òÖ Lorna Jane Mitchell ‚Äì Advanced Git for developers &lt;small&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;http://joind.in/talk/view/15020&quot;&gt;joind.in&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plenty of examples and takeaways. I‚Äôve seen elements of this talk before but there‚Äôs always more to learn with git. Lorna presents it really well with live examples. &lt;code&gt;git rebase -i&lt;/code&gt; FTW!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚òÖ Konstantin Kudryashov ‚Äì &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/mobile/everzet/minmaxing-software-costs-laracon-eu-2015&quot;&gt;Min-maxing software costs&lt;/a&gt; &lt;small&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;http://joind.in/talk/view/15022&quot;&gt;joind.in&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the second time I‚Äôve seen Konstantin speak (the first being at PHP North West 2014), and like the first time, he didn‚Äôt fail to deliver. This guy knows his stuff and explains it well. This talk was code related but actually showed very little code. In fact, the takeaway was ‚ÄúCode as little as you can‚Äù. That‚Äôs somewhat simplified, but the premise is that through experience and gained knowledge you weigh up when to write something from scratch and when to use existing code from another developer. The concepts of &lt;em&gt;Cost of Introduction&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Costs of Change&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Cost of Ownership&lt;/em&gt; helped me define my thoughts and I‚Äôll certainly consider these things going forward on new projects far more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately I had a plane to catch so had to leave early during the last talk, which I was really annoyed about, since it was Jeffrey Way!

&lt;p&gt;All the talks have been of a very high standard but the two, well, three, that stand out most are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚òÖ Matt Stauffer ‚Äì &lt;a href=&quot;https://speakerdeck.com/mattstauffer/empathy-gives-you-superpowers&quot;&gt;Empathy Gives You Superpowers&lt;/a&gt; &lt;small&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;http://joind.in/talk/view/15013&quot;&gt;joind.in&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/small&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the keynote talk and set the scene. Empathy makes you a better person, a better coder, a better‚Ä¶ everything in all aspects of your life. Having empathy¬†takes times to learn and develop and should be practiced. Specifically with coding, it will empower you to better understand your users and therefore build better user experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚òÖ Adam Wathan ‚Äì Chasing Perfect &lt;small&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;http://joind.in/talk/view/15017&quot;&gt;joind.in&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/small&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some live refactoring action that explained a design pattern I hadn‚Äôt heard before: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_Object_pattern&quot;&gt;The Null Object pattern&lt;/a&gt;. Well explained and entertainingly presented. I‚Äôll defenitely be using this in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚òÖ Taylor Otwell ‚Äì The Tao of Laravel &lt;small&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;http://joind.in/talk/view/15018&quot;&gt;joind.in&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, the talk by the man himself. Taylor opened with the philosophies behind what he is doing ‚Äì to take away all the pain points of app development, and then introduced Laravel Spark. This is more boilerplate code that gets you to where you want to be quicker, so you can start building your actual application and not have to repeatedly code, login, authentication, user groups, subscriptions, billing‚Ä¶ another game changer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm ready for day 2.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Cull (my time is precious)]]></title><description><![CDATA[I‚Äôve spent the entire bank holiday weekend decorating.

I‚Äôve not had time to keep up with my constant stream of information. Then I listened to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.merlinmann.com/roderick/ep-122-parliament-of-the-moment.html&quot;&gt;Roderick on the Line #122 ‚Äì Parliament of the Moment&lt;/a&gt; (I‚Äôm a little behind on Roderick, they‚Äôre on 155 now. If only I had more time).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, John and Merlin discuss phone distraction. The constant stream of information coming at you and the vying of your attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a 4 year old son, he demands attention, lots and lots of it. Sometimes I give that attention to my phone. I feel bad about that. ‚ÄúAm I missing something?‚Äù; gnaws away at me. Any opportunity to whip the phone out and check, I take it. I‚Äôm an addicted slave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who I follow started around 7 years ago. Twitter was fairly new and I worked at Singletrack. I followed people and they followed me because of my connection to bikes. People I don‚Äôt know. They‚Äôre interesting and nice people. But they‚Äôre not friends, they‚Äôre not even acquaintances. Most I‚Äôve never even met. I haven‚Äôt unfollowed because of my desire to not offend anyone. I wouldn‚Äôt unfollow if they followed me. That‚Äôs when I started my list system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At time of writing I follow 224 people on Twitter. I manage this into lists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The people I work with&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A list of ‚Äúdevs‚Äù ‚Äì to get information about what‚Äôs going on in the developer community&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apps ‚Äì information about apps that I use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;‚ú© ‚Äì the fun list. People I know. Things that make me laugh.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This totals about 100 that I actively follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can‚Äôt be bothered anymore. I love you all but I don‚Äôt love you so much that you can take my precious time. That 100 ‚Äúactive follow‚Äù list will be dwindling too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is free reign to unfollow me. I won‚Äôt be offended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you need me, you can find me.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Squarethreat]]></title><description><![CDATA[Are these amazing website builders threatening your agency?

Potentially. It all depends on where you place yourself in the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People and businesses are getting more web savvy and at the same time fantastic tools are being developed that allow the building of beatiful fast and responsive websites that cost next to nothing. Anyone can come along and build what they need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initiatives like &lt;a href=&quot;https://digitalgarage.withgoogle.com/#/&quot;&gt;Digital Garage from Google&lt;/a&gt; are springing up to help businesses use the web effectively. Web knowledge is increasing exponentially. The next generation of business owners will have had the internet throughout their entire lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That‚Äôs not a threat to anyone. That‚Äôs a boon for the web development agencies. It makes businesses think about the web more and gives them training to realise that they need to have a web presence. And not just a web presence but to use the web and software for their internal processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To begin with the business establishes itself on the web using these low cost tools. They may be on this system for a year, or 10 years, until they start to outgrow it. Their meetings start containing phrases begining with ‚Äúcan we just‚Ä¶‚Äù, ‚Äúwouldn‚Äôt it be great if‚Ä¶‚Äù followed by ‚Äúyeah, but no‚Ä¶‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The business will have seen the value of the web. They‚Äôll have issues within the business that advanced functionality on their website can solve. They may know what solution they want implementing and they‚Äôll have a go at it themselves ‚Äì perhaps succesfully, perhaps not. Or they may not know how to solve this problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They‚Äôll have outgrown the platform and their knowledge will no longer be sufficient to be effective. This is where the agency steps in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agency can offer a broader spectrum of knowledge. It can look at a business from the outside and provide solutions because they‚Äôre not so engrained in what has come before that they can‚Äôt think outside the box. The agency will have experience of multiple projects, reading and research ‚Äì broad knowledge on when existing solutions can be employed and when it‚Äôs time to build something bespoke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The role of the agency is to establish the picture that need painting. This may not be clear to start with so analysis will be done. Analytics research, interviews with the employees and the end users. The agency takes it all that step further to find the right solution to the problem. They may even need to establish what the problem actually is because the business presents to the agency with a solution ‚Äì having never actually specified what needs to be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agency may build the end product on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.squarespace.com/&quot;&gt;Squarespace&lt;/a&gt;. Or &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/&quot;&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt;. Or &lt;a href=&quot;http://magento.com/&quot;&gt;Magento&lt;/a&gt;. Or it may be custom built. Or &lt;em&gt;insert whatever you want here&lt;/em&gt;. That doesn‚Äôt matter. What matters is the problem originally presented is solved. That is what a good agency can do.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
